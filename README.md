This is git repository for Firefox Extension HTML Universal Speed Control (open source) browser extension that allows users to control the playback speed of web content. I specifically created this for those shady ad websites, that adds a timer to get links. This is inspired from HTML5 Universal Speed Hack extension in Chrome Webstore.

The extension is particularly useful for:

Time-based websites, that makes you wait.
Video/audio content playback
Animations
Learning/tutorial websites
Game speed modifications
It's designed to work across different browsers and platforms, with special optimizations for mobile devices to ensure smooth performance.
