This is git repository for Firefox Extension HTML Universal Speed Control (open source) browser extension that allows users to control the playback speed of web content. I specifically created this for those shady ad websites, that adds a timer to get links. This is inspired from HTML5 Universal Speed Hack extension in Chrome Webstore.

The extension is particularly useful for:

- Bypassing waiting timers on ad websites
- Skipping timed redirects on download pages
- Accelerating countdown timers to access content quickly
- Speeding up "Please wait X seconds" screens
- Circumventing timed paywalls and content restrictions

It's designed to work across different browsers and platforms, with special optimizations for mobile devices to ensure smooth performance when dealing with annoying ad timers.
